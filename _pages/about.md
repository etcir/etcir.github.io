# About the Workshop

Conversational Information Retrieval (CIR) has attracted growing research interest in recent years, particularly since the emergence of conversational agents based on generative AI methods. In this workshop, we aim to collect views, opinions and emerging perspective in the context of CIR. The purpose of this workshop is to provide a forum for discussion on the emerging trends in conversational information retrieval. The workshop will explore different areas relating to CIR systems. The workshop would be a full-day workshop with keynotes focusing on either in-depth analysis or broad-ranging approaches to conversational information retrieval. It will include an invited keynote speaker and presentations of papers. The results of the workshop will be published at the SIGIR Forum.
